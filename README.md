# Background
We're a growth analyst at MercadoLibreLinks to an external site.. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. We've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, we want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

# What You're Creating
In a bid to drive revenue, we’ve produce a Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. 
Specifically:
+ Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.
+ An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.
+ A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

# Requirements
For this project we are using the machine learning tool
+ prophet
+ pandas
+ numpy
+ hvplot
+ pathlib
+ holoviews
